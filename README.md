# Deep-Learning-COVID-19-on-CXR-using-Limited-Training-Data-Sets
Github repository for Deep Learning COVID-19 on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets

This is the Github repository for "Deep Learning COVID-19 on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets".

The proposed method consists of two-step approaches, namely "making segmentation mask" and "classification".
Each tasks are uploaded in seperated folders.

To make segmentation masks, you can use codes included in "segmentation folder".
After making segmentation masks, generated masks as well as preprocessed x-ray images should be moved to "classification folder".
