This is the Github repository for "Deep Learning COVID-19 on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets".

The proposed method consists of two-step approaches, namely "making segmentation mask" and "classification".
Each tasks are uploaded in seperated folders.

# Instructions
-------
To make segmentation masks, you can use codes included in "segmentation folder".
After making segmentation masks, generated masks as well as preprocessed x-ray images should be moved to "classification folder".

The detailed instruction is provided below.
